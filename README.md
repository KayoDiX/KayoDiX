# What up biatch!

Hello, and welcome to another branch of the amazing world of KayoDiX, formerly known as the KayiWorld. My name is KayoDiX, But you can call me KDiX.

# Myself or smth like that

Welp, leaving outside the jokes, my name is Diego F., and i love chilaquiles verdes con pollo. I'm mexican, and yes i clearly know english.

I'm a proudly an student from the IPN! And I'm probably gonna keep studying about smth related to this, but my plans are about studying cibersecurity.

I'm a bassist, a music producer, a spriter, a pixelarter, a little bit of a youtuber and a game maker. YEYYYYYYYYY!!!

I really love Programming! I'm planning some projects out here that are probably gonna help me to get more experience here in this territorry.

I've always loved computers, but mostly Operating Systems! I've always wanted to make one, even if it's more simple than walking.

# My plans out here

- Creating funny projects
- Making simple API's!
- Learning more and more and more things!
- Waste tim- I mean, distract myself with something productive

# Notes

También voy a poner cosas en español, porque me da hueva ponerlas en inglés o porque escribí el codigo en español (aunque muy pocas veces lo voy a hacer).

I love sleeping with my cat Manchitas Gato. yeah i love him.
